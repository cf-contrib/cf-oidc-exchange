//! The broker's readiness check, for `/health/ready`.
//!
//! [`Config::from_env`] checks what it can without reading anything: the
//! bindings and the policy, and a Worker that fails it serves nothing.
//! [`ConfigCheck`] checks the rest of the configuration, what only reading it
//! can: the secrets an exchange reads, the Cloudflare token, and the signing
//! key if one is bound, imported as the broker would sign with it. A secret
//! that's bound but can't be read, say one Secrets Store won't hand over, then
//! shows up as `503` on the probe, with why in the log, not only as a `500` on
//! the first exchange.
//!
//! It doesn't call Cloudflare's API to verify the token: the endpoint is
//! public, and anyone probing it would spend the token's rate limit.
