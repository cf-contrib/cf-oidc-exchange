# cloudflare-sts-core

OIDC tokens in Cloudflare Workers: verifying them, for any issuer (GitHub
Actions, GitLab CI, Cloudflare Access, or a broker that issues its own), and
signing them, for a Worker that is an issuer. cloudflare-sts verifies the
tokens exchanges present with it and signs its own, and
[cloudflare-nix](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cloudflare-nix) verifies the tokens
uploads present.

Accepting a token takes two steps. `Providers::verify` validates it as a JWT, as RFC 7519
§7.2 and RFC 8725 say:

- It picks its provider by its `iss`, which must be one a provider names
  exactly.
- Its JOSE Header must have `alg` RS256 and no `crit`, and the `typ` the
  provider names, if it names one, compared as a media type
  (`application/AT+JWT` is `at+jwt`).
- Its RS256 signature is checked with the runtime's WebCrypto, so no RSA crate
  ends up in the wasm. The keys are that issuer's, found through its OpenID
  Provider Metadata, its Authorization Server Metadata (RFC 8414) if it has
  none, either of which must name the same issuer, or a configured `jwks_uri`:
  never through anything in the token, and
  only over HTTPS (or plain HTTP on loopback). Keys whose `use`, `key_ops` or
  `alg` say they aren't for RS256 signatures are skipped.
- Its registered claims are validated: `iss`, `aud` (a trailing `/` ignored),
  `exp`, which it must have, and `nbf`, if it has one, with 60 seconds of clock
  tolerance. Any registered claim of
  the wrong type refuses it.

Then `ClaimRules::authorize` matches its claims against the policy, which no
RFC covers.

```rust
use cloudflare_sts_core::{ClaimRules, Provider, Providers};

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct MyProviderConfig { issuer: String, audience: String, jwks_uri: Option<String>, typ: Option<String>, claims: ClaimRules }

impl Provider for MyProviderConfig {
    fn issuer(&self) -> &str { &self.issuer }
    fn audience(&self) -> &str { &self.audience }
    // Optional: where its keys are, and the typ its tokens must have.
    fn jwks_uri(&self) -> Option<&str> { self.jwks_uri.as_deref() }
    fn typ(&self) -> Option<&str> { self.typ.as_deref() }
}

// Deserialized with the rest of your configuration, then checked, which says
// where anything's wrong: "providers[0].issuer must be an https:// URL".
let providers: Providers<MyProviderConfig> = serde_json::from_str(json)?;
providers.check("providers")?;
for (i, provider) in providers.iter().enumerate() {
    provider.claims.check(&format!("providers[{i}].claims"))?;
}

// In a Worker, before the handler. The future isn't Send: wrap it in
// worker::send::SendFuture where axum wants one.
let (provider, jwt) = providers.verify(&token).await?;
let rule = provider.claims.authorize(&jwt.claims)?;
let sub = jwt.claims.sub();                // the registered claims, typed
let repo = jwt.claims.get("repository");  // any other, by name

// Later, for the same token, without verifying it again.
let jwt = cloudflare_sts_core::verified(&token);

// A Worker that issues tokens: sign them, and publish the key's public half.
let key = cloudflare_sts_core::SigningKey::import(&pkcs8_pem).await?;
let signed = key.sign_access_token(AccessTokenClaims { iss, sub, aud, client_id, iat, exp, other }).await?;
let signed = key.sign(claims).await?;      // any other JWT; signed.jwt, signed.jti
let jwk = key.public_jwk();

// A resource server that takes only access tokens from that Worker names
// typ: Some(cloudflare_sts_core::AT_JWT) for it.

| | |
|---|---|
| `Provider` | An OpenID Provider whose tokens are accepted: its issuer, the audience its tokens must be for, and optionally its `jwks_uri` and the `typ` its tokens must have. Implement it on your configuration's type. It only says what's configured: verifying is `Providers`'. |
| `Providers` | The providers, deserialized from a JSON array. `verify` validates a token against the one its `iss` names, keeps it until it expires, and returns that provider and the `Jwt`; `find` looks one up by issuer; `check` checks the configuration, saying where. It derefs to the slice. |
| `ClaimRules` | The policy: claim rules, deserialized from a JSON array. `authorize` gives the index of the first one a token's claims match, `matches` says whether any does, `names` lists the claims they match on, and `check` that there's one at all. It derefs to the slice of `ClaimRule`s. |
| `verified` | A token `Providers::verify` accepted in this isolate, if it hasn't expired. |
| `Jwt` | A verified token: its `Header` and its `Claims`. |
| `Header` | The JOSE Header parameters it was verified by: `alg`, `kid` and `typ`. `typ_is` compares its `typ` as a media type. |
| `Claims` | The JWT Claims Set. `iss()`, `sub()`, `aud()`, `exp()`, `nbf()`, `iat()`, `jti()`, and RFC 8693's `client_id()` and `scope()`, read the registered claims; it derefs to the JSON object, so any claim reads by name. `From` and `into_inner` convert from and to the object. |
| `AccessTokenClaims` | The claims RFC 9068 requires of a JWT access token (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `client_id`, `iat`, `exp`), and any others. |
| `ClaimRule` | One rule: claim name to pattern, deserialized from a JSON object. A pattern is exact, or a prefix ending in one `*`; `*_id` claims must be exact. It's a non-empty string, a whole number or a boolean, and a rule names at least one claim. Numbers and booleans compare as written, and a list claim matches if any entry does. `matches` and `names` as for `ClaimRules`. |
| `Error` | RFC 6750's codes: `InvalidToken` (an invalid token, or an issuer no provider is for), `InsufficientScope` (no claim rule matches), or `TemporarilyUnavailable` (the issuer's keys couldn't be had, or WebCrypto failed). |
| `SigningKey` | An RSA private key (PKCS#8 PEM, at least 2048 bits) imported into WebCrypto. Its `kid`, which `kid` gives, is the public key's RFC 7638 thumbprint, so a new key gets a new one. `sign_access_token` signs `AccessTokenClaims` as an RFC 9068 access token (`typ` `at+jwt`), and `sign` any `Claims` as a JWT (`typ` `JWT`), both with RS256 and a fresh `jti`; `public_jwk` is what a JWK Set publishes. |
| `JWT`, `AT_JWT` | The `typ`s `sign` and `sign_access_token` give tokens, for `Provider::typ`. |
| `ALGORITHM` | `RS256`, the one algorithm tokens are verified and signed with. |
| `SignedToken` | The signed JWT, and its `jti`. |
| `KeyError` | Why a key can't be imported, or a token signed. |
| `check_url` | Whether a URL is HTTPS, or plain HTTP on loopback: for checking other URLs in your configuration as providers' are. |

Issuers have 10 seconds to answer. Each issuer's keys are cached per isolate for 10 minutes, and a `kid` the
cache doesn't know refetches them at most every 30 seconds. A token without a
`kid` takes the issuer's only key. Verified tokens are cached per isolate by
the token's SHA-256, at most 1024 of them.

The source is split by role, then by the RFCs' layers within it: `jwt` is
the token format both roles share (RFC 7515, 7519, 9068) and knows nothing of
providers; `verify` is the resource server's side, with an issuer's `keys`
(RFC 7517), its `metadata` (OpenID Connect Discovery, RFC 8414) and the claim
rules' `policy`; `sign` is the issuer's side; `crypto` does RS256 through
WebCrypto for both; and `error` is what goes wrong.
